# README for Tiny Network Exploer (TNE)
Tiny Network Explorer (TNE) sends a UDP broadcast to a specific port. A "Tiny Server"
listens on this specific port and responds with its configuration settings. Some additional
information like system name and version is also sent. With TNE the user can change the
settings and sends them back to the "Tiny Server". Here the new settings are saved and
the device restarts. This procedure also works if an incorrect IP address or netmask was
set. TNE finds only devices in the same subnet.
